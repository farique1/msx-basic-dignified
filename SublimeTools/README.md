# Sublime Tools for MSX Basic Dignified

Three files to help work with **MSX Basic Dignified** on **Sublime Text 3**.

- A `tmPreferences` adding `REM` to the comment shortcut.
- A `tmTheme` based on Monkai with special scopes.
- A `sublime-syntax` with a pretty complete MSX Basic highlight scheme plus additional highlights specially designed for **MSX Basic Dignified**.
