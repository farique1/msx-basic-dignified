# MSX Basic example and conversions

`CGK_source_test.bas`  
An MSX Basic test code to showcase some features of **MSX Basic Dignified.**  
The highlight observations are for the [`MSX Basic.sublime-syntax`](https://github.com/farique1/msx-basic-dignified/tree/master/SublimeTools)

And several native MSX Basic converted with different settings.

`CGK_conv_default.bas`  
Converted with no arguments.  

`CGK_conv_args_01.bas`  
Converted with ` -sl -br`

`CGK_conv_args_02.bas`  
Converted with `-gs 0 -ll 2`
